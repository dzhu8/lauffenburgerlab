### Research Overview
Impact of TAM receptors on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of macrophages

I am interested in understanding the heterogeneity of the immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the connection between the immune response and disease outcomes. Currently, I am investigating immune correlates of protection in tuberculosis in a genetically diverse cohort of mice using a multivariate computational approach. I am also studying how different forms of macrophage death and the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mertk) family of receptors in tuberculosis differentially lead to inflammation patterns and bacterial control. I also have broader interests in teaching and mentoring and helping to develop those skills in my peers.
