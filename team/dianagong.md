### Overview
Co-advised by Bryan Bryson

I am interested in understanding the heterogeneity of response of different cell types and different patients to inflammatory and infectious disease. Currently, I am analyzing how different mutations impact the immune environment in colorectal cancer using single-cell RNA sequencing. Moving forward, I will also be studying correlates of protection in tuberculosis by using a multi-omics approach and developing computational models.
