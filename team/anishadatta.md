### Overview

Immunotherapy has shown great promise as a cancer therapeutic; however, its efficacy is limited to a subset of patients, necessitating further study of the mechanisms at play. One mechanism of particular interest is the recruitment and infiltration of T cells into the tumor, as studies have shown that tumors that have been infiltrated by these adaptive immune cells respond positively to immunotherapies as compared to tumors that do not have T cell infiltration. Given that there is cross-talk between innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells - in that the former help prime and activate the latter - there has been great interest in the factors that contribute to and determine whether innate immune cells carry out this vital function. My project focuses on a family of receptor tyrosine kinases known as the TAM receptors, and I am specifically studying Axl. Studies have demonstrated that targeting Axl and blocking it from carrying out its functions yields an immunostimulatory state in innate immune cells and decreases aggression and invasion in cancer cells. Thus, it is likely that anti-Axl therapies may synergize with immunotherapies. My work aims to understand how anti-Axl treatment alters the tumor immune landscape, thereby allowing for a better understanding of which immunotherapies it would synergize with as well as which patients would benefit most from such a combination.
