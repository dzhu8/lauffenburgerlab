### Overview
The purpose of my research is to enable computer-designed therapies against disease. Currently, drug development is challenged by the complexity of intracellular signaling. This could be overcome by computer models that predict cellular responses, however, current models are limited in scope, generalizability and ease of parameterization. I am developing a method, based on artificial neural networks, to model cellular signal-integration on a mechanistic level. The model integrates data from cells that are stimulated with many combinations of ligands. I am particularly interested in using it to better understand the role of macrophages in cancer and tuberculosis.
