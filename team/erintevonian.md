### Research Overview
Engineered liver models for the characterization of immune-tissue interactions in hepatic insulin resistance

Hepatic insulin resistance is a major feature of the progression of metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. My work focuses on developing an improved in vitro hepatic insulin resistance model incorporating primary human 3D cell culture, physiologically relevant media conditions, and tissue-immune crosstalk. By applying systems biology approaches integrating multi-omics data generated with this insulin resistance model, I aim to better understand the interplay between molecular and cellular cues driving disease.
