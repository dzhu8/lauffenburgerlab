### Overview
My research interest is in using high-throughput data generation methods, large datasets, and computational models to investigate infectious disease impact, progression, and biomarkers. I am particularly interested in intrinsic variation in immune response within populations in addition to differences between disease severities. Currently, I am researching immune response and mechanisms of protection for tuberculosis.
