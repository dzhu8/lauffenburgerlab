### Overview
Systems biology analysis of immune mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease

While amyloid and tau pathology are defining characteristics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), they do not robustly correlate with disease severity. Nonetheless, amyloid and tau dysregulation are key features in a majority of AD mouse models used for preclinical evaluation of therapies. To address this limitation, I am applying a computational framework developed in the lab for inter-species translation of molecular/phenotype relationships, taking a consensus-driven approach across diverse mouse models that recapitulate different biochemical and cellular aspects of human AD. Specifically, this project aims to identify features of AD mouse model transcriptomic signatures predictive of human disease outcomes via a principal component regression. Identifying translatable signatures could provide a framework for rationally selecting multiple mouse models for preclinical testing.

Additionally, I am following up on a subset of computationally-identified translatable signatures related to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway and angiogenesis response. I am using a mechanistic modeling framework combined with quantitative experiments to understand subcellular changes related to predicted, translatable signatures with an initial focus on signaling and trafficking disruption in neurons.
