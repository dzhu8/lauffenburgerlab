### Overview
Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective medical interventions for combating infectious disease. That being said, efficacious vaccines have yet to be developed for some of the deadliest of these diseases, including HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Influenza. Currently vaccine development is limited by our knowledge of correlates of immunity against infection. I am interested in utilizing machine learning techniques to reveal antibody and immune cell effector functions predictive of disease protection. This information may lead to better understanding of disease mechanisms and allow us to rationally design more effective vaccines.
