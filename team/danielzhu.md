### Overview
Computational Methods for Large-Scale Biological Data Analysis

I am interested in learning how cellular heterogeneity tracks with differential outcomes in immune response in different disease contexts and across tissues and organisms, particularly in pathologies that present with complex higher-order structure, such as cancers and tuberculosis. To do so, I work in developing computational frameworks equipped to handle high-throughput single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics data. Currently, my focus is in probing cell-to-cell communication and in the contextualization of these events within the whole transcriptome of the tissue.
