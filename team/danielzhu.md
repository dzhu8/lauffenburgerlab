### Overview
I am broadly interested in applying machine learning techniques alongside more traditional experimental methods to gain insight into problems rooted in biology and medicine. In particular, I am currently interested in studying the highly complex networks of interactions involving immune cells in a pathological context, to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system controls and evolves correlates of protection against disease. New insights uncovered by this process could then guide the development of targeted therapeutics against the long-standing threat posed by maladies such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. At the moment, these efforts face challenges in the form of the scale of the networks involved and the frequent lack of direct translatability of insights discovered in animal models to the human context. In the near future, I hope to leverage machine learning to find and predict relationships in the interactome that might not be immediately obvious, intuitive or easily assayable, and in doing so, construct hypotheses that can then be tested experimentally, identify animal features that are predictive of human disease outcomes, and develop a deeper understanding of the systems-level components that underpin progression towards said outcomes.
