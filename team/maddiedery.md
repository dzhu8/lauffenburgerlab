### Overview
IgA antibodies play a multifaceted role in the immune system. In the presence of pathogens, IgA immune complexes form which can trigger an inflammatory response. This response is desirable in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer but has also been linked to many autoimmune diseases when it becomes overactive, potentially due to excessive recruitment of neutrophils. My research aims to better understand what factors control the nature of the IgA immune response using high-throughput assays to measure neutrophil-mediated effector functions with the goal of informing the development of therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
