# Lauffenburger Lab

This website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/misc/about/), and further modified by the lab of [Dr. Stephan Sanders](https://sanderslab.github.io/). We thank Drs. Drummond, Bedford and Sanders for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](URL TBD) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dzhu8/lauffenburgerlab). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab and Drummond lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
