The Lauffenburger laboratory emphasizes experimental and mathematical/computational analysis for the development and validation of predictive models for physiologically-relevant behavior in a wide variety of biological settings and disease contexts. Our work has been recognized as fostering the interface of bioengineering, quantitative cell biology and systems biology. 


Our current areas of research include:

1. **Finding correlates of protection against infectious disease**: *blurb here*
2. **Understanding tuberculosis progression at cellular and systemic level**: *blurb here*
3. **Species translation**: *blurb here*
4. **Signaling in cancer**: *blurb here*
5. **Single-cell methods**: Developing new computational tools for representing and leveraging single-cell omics towards understanding the contribution of heterogenous cell states to disease. 

### Technologies and methods
We utilize a variety of computational frameworks, including [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4346.pdf), Partial Least-Squares ([see section 2](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11752790.pdf)), [Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/canonical-correlation-analysis/), [Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA)](https://www.embopress.org/doi/epdf/10.15252/msb.20178124), and neural networks. Additionally, we work with eukaryotic cells and a range of cellular characterization techniques, such as flow cytometry and Luminex.   

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [Griffith Lab](https://lgglab.mit.edu/), [Bryson Lab](https://brysonlab.mit.edu/) and [White Lab](https://white-lab.mit.edu/) at MIT, the [Alter Lab](https://ragoninstitute.org/alter/) and [Fortune Lab](https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/fortune-lab/) at Harvard, the [Sassetti Lab](https://www.umassmed.edu/sassettilab/) and [Behar Lab](https://www.umassmed.edu/maps/research-labs/behar/about-us/) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and the Flynn lab at the University of Pittsburgh. 

### Openings
**Postdoctoral Position Available**:
A position is available immediately for a postdoctoral associate in the Lauffenburger Laboratory at MIT, with focus on experimental systems biology studies of immune / tissue interactions in inflammatory pathophysiology applications and emphasis on therapeutic translation. Approaches feature omic interrogation of in vivo samples along with complex in vitro culture platforms, across a spectrum of application areas including pathogen infection, cancer immunotherapy, diabetes, and endometriosis. Applicants should send a letter of interest and CV to Doug Lauffenburger at lauffen@mit.edu.
